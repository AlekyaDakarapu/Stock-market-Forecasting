# 📈 Stock Market Forecasting & Trading Strategy using Technical Indicators

This project demonstrates a rule-based algorithmic trading strategy on stock market data using technical indicators like Moving Averages, RSI, and MACD. It retrieves historical data from Alpha Vantage API, generates buy/sell signals, and evaluates strategy performance compared to a Buy & Hold approach.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. 🔑 **API Setup**
- Sign up at [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) to get your **free API key**.
- Set your API key in the script/notebook using:
  ```python
  API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
  ```

### 2. 📥 **Data Collection**
- Use the Alpha Vantage API to fetch **daily stock price data**.
- Save the data to a CSV file for reuse:
  ```python
  df.to_csv("AAPL_historical_data.csv")
  ```

### 3. 🧹 **Data Preprocessing**
- Load CSV into a DataFrame
- Parse dates, sort by time, and clean missing values
- Display summary statistics and structure

### 4. 📊 **Visualization**
- Plot historical closing prices
- Overlay moving averages:
  - 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)
  - 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

### 5. 💹 **Signal Generation**
- Define buy/sell signals using:
  - Golden Cross (SMA 50 > SMA 200) → Buy
  - Death Cross (SMA 50 < SMA 200) → Sell
- Visualize crossover points

### 6. 💰 **Strategy Backtesting**
- Simulate a portfolio with:
  - Initial capital ($10,000)
  - Trading decisions based on signal crossover
- Track and plot:
  - Strategy portfolio value
  - Buy & Hold value

### 7. 📈 **Advanced Indicators**
- Add:
  - RSI (Relative Strength Index)
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- Combine them to refine signals:
  - RSI < 30 and MACD Bullish → Buy
  - RSI > 70 and MACD Bearish → Sell

### 8. 📉 **Improved Strategy**
- Implement combined signal-based trading
- Track trades, portfolio value, and drawdowns

### 9. 📊 **Performance Metrics**
- Total Return
- Number of Trades & Win Rate
- Max Drawdown

## 🧪 Results

- 📈 Strategy Return: **$10,000.00**
- 💹 Win Rate: **nan%**
- 📉 Max Drawdown: **0.00%**
- ✅ Strategy outperformed Buy & Hold (if applicable)
